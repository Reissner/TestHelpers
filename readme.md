# Testhelpers

This package offers elementary classes which proved useful 
for tests of software made at simuline (www.simuline.eu).
For further pieces of information see the homepage http://www.simuline.eu/TestHelpers/index.html. 

The functionality is
- an accessor class for whitebox tests
- a static class providing specialized assertions
- a gui to run tests and testsuites selectively and interactively.

Although most of the classes are outdated if usin new junit5
in combination with modern IDEs,
the testhelpers are still used at (www.simuline.eu).

Originally, the GUI filled the gap for the IDE given by the emacs plugin jdee.
The assertions class provided completed the assertions offered by junit4.
Solely the accessor seems really up to date at the time of this writing.

Anyway, if you want, feel free to use this piece of software.
