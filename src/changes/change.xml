<!-- TBD: restore the icons for open, run, stop, break and exit. -->
<!-- release plan:
  - eliminate GUI as it is no longer needed
    doubt this: maybe some time update to JavaFX even 
  - extend parameter to allow emacsclient and vs code. 
  - in GUI add a label showing the current version and build time. 
  - add time consumption and memory consumption to the outputs. 
    This shall be done for the leaves of the test tree and also accumulation for the other nodes. 
  - added console output. 
  - make the script part of the distribution: include it and tell how to extract 
    using dependency plugin in the user project. 
  - in script part include check that it is invoked in base directory. 
    Then also many pieces of information are from different sources. 
    Try to read off the pom to obtain less configuration work. 
  - trigger recompile after save. 
    vscode: "editor.codeActionsOnSave": { "source.fixAll.eslint": true }
    emacs: after-save-hook
  - add history and a bit of user guidance. 
  - make mvn site-deploy functional
  - eliminate warnings, in particular PMD
  - in eu.simuline.testhelpers.DTestHelper.createPower2() try with return value int instead of double. 
    This unveils weaknesses in L2R, concerning testcases 
    but also concerning overflow of correction and tolerance.
